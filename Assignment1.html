    <p>I'm a paragraph.
        <strong>I rant alot </strong>, I talk about a lot of things. Sometimes, even things that don't make any sense (Look at my
        twin down there.) I'm also diagnosed with OCD. That's why I keep things organized and wrapped, unless some
        <span>span</span> comes and disorganizes me!

    <div>
        I'm a div. I'm like the walls that keep elements from tresspacing over each other. Sometimes I'm dull and boring. Sometimes
        I'm bright and decorated. I wonder who gets to change me up like that?
